    <h1>Return & Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>This Return & Refund Policy (‚ÄúPolicy‚Äù) constitutes an integral part of the service terms between <strong>ZISTRI TECHNOLOGIES PVT LTD</strong> (‚ÄúCompany‚Äù, ‚ÄúInstant Mechanic‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe‚Äù, ‚ÄúUs‚Äù or ‚ÄúOur‚Äù) and the customer (‚ÄúClient‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour‚Äù) availing roadside assistance and associated services (‚ÄúServices‚Äù).</p>

    <p>By initiating a booking and/or making payment for any Service, the Client acknowledges having read, understood, and agreed to be bound by the terms set forth herein.</p>

    <h2>1. Refund Request Submission</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Any request for a refund must be formally submitted by the Client in writing to <span class="email">üìß info.instantmechanic@gmail.com</span>, with the subject line: <br><em>Refund Request ‚Äì [Client‚Äôs Mobile Number]</em></li>
        <li>The written request shall mandatorily contain:
            <ul>
                <li>Client‚Äôs mobile number</li>
                <li>Vehicle registration number</li>
                <li>Service description</li>
                <li>Amount paid</li>
                <li>Reason for refund request in detail</li>
                <li>Location at which the Service was scheduled/delivered</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Refund requests lacking the above particulars, or containing materially inaccurate information, shall be deemed invalid and shall not be processed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. Non-Refundable Scenarios</h2>
    <p>Without prejudice to any other rights of the Company, no refund shall be due or payable under the following circumstances, whether in full or in part:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Service is booked, and the reported fault is resolved or ceases to exist prior to the arrival of the Company‚Äôs technician/representative.</li>
        <li>The Service is booked, and the Client elects to obtain services from a third-party provider in lieu of the Company‚Äôs dispatched personnel.</li>
        <li>Upon inspection, the vehicle is determined to have a major defect, structural damage, or a requirement for workshop-level repair/part replacement, rendering on-site resolution unfeasible.</li>
        <li>The Service is delivered and the reported fault is addressed, but the same or a similar issue reoccurs at any later time, irrespective of the cause of recurrence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Processing & Timelines</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Any refund, if approved at the sole discretion of the Company, shall be processed within seven (7) to ten (10) business days from the date of such approval.</li>
        <li>All refunds shall be made using the original payment method used by the Client for the booking, unless otherwise determined by the Company.</li>
        <li>The Company reserves the right to require additional documentation, verification, or evidence from the Client prior to making any refund determination.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. Final & Binding Determination</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>All decisions of the Company regarding refund eligibility, amount, and method of payment shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon the Client and shall not be subject to further appeal, dispute, or contestation.</li>
        <li>The Client expressly waives any right to initiate chargebacks, payment disputes, or legal claims in relation to refunds, except where such waiver is expressly prohibited by applicable law.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. Acknowledgment</h2>
    <p>By proceeding with a Service booking, the Client:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Confirms full understanding that roadside assistance involves immediate allocation of resources and mobilisation of personnel, incurring non-recoverable operational costs from the point of confirmation.</li>
        <li>Irrevocably accepts that refunds are exceptional remedies and not standard entitlements.</li>
    </ul>
